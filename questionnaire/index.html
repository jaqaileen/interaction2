    <h2>Describe your previous experiences with coding.</h2>
    <p class="answer">I have not coded before last semester, so my skills are quite limited to Core1: Interaction. However, I did utilize a lot of JavaScript in my Harmonic Collection to keep the website engaging. I also spent the winter break coding my portfolio website from scratch.</p>

    <h2>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>
    <p class="answer">HTML is like the blueprint of a house, defining its structure. CSS is the interior designer, making it visually appealing.
